# collatz-collection
A collection of games and interactive statistics about the Collatz conjecture.

## 1 Collatz conjecture
### 1.1 Procedure
Start with a number n ∊ ℕ
- If n is odd → n becomes n / 2.
- If n is even → n becomes 3n + 1.
- Repeat

### 1.2 Examples
8 → 4 → 2 → 1 → 4 → ...

5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1 → 4 → ...

### 1.3 Conclusion
Any number sequence of a starting number n ∊ ℕ (Collatz sequence)
ends in the following scheme 4 → 2 → 1 → 4 → ...

### 1.4 Problem
1.3 has not been proven.

## 2 Collatz-Steps
The length of the Collatz sequence is the number of steps required
to get to the value 1.
